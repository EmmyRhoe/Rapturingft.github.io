    WATER BAPTISM 

Baptizo and Baptisma are Greek words translated as baptize and baptism respectively. 

Baptizo (to baptize) is derived from the Greek word, ‘Bapto' which means to overwhelm, i.e. cover wholly with a fluid; to immerse, dip. Baptize itself means to overwhelm, make fully wet. 

Baptisma on the other hand denotes baptism consisting of the process of immersion, submersion and emergence and is used (1) of John's baptism, (2) of Christian baptism, (3) of the overwhelming afflictions and judgments to which the Lord voiuntarily submitted on the Cross (Luke 12:50), (4) of the sufferings Christ's followers would experience, not of a vicarious character, but in fellowship with the sufferings of their master (Mark 10:38-39) 

Baptism is used only in the New Testament for ceremonial ablution especially of the ordinance of Christ 

The Right Way of Baptism 

From the above definitions, it is clear that water baptism must be done by immersion otherwise it is not baptism since baptism means immersion or dipping. Sprinkling water on people does not constitute the ritual of water baptism, besides; there is no record of such in the Bible or history in the days of the apostles. “Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death...” Romans 6:4. “Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.” Colossians 2:12. 

Some Christians who believe in water baptism by immersion debate the way the immersion should be done; some say the person being baptized should be dipped facing forward and 



some say the person ought to be dipped tilting backward. To me, such arguments are unfounded, uncalled for. | believe what is important is that we are identified with the death burial and resurrection of Christ as is written in the Scriptures. Which direction we face is irrelevant. 

The Correct Name for Baptism Matthew 28:19 states, “Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, 

baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:” 

The above statement of Christ Himself constituted part of the last commandment He gave His disciples before His ascension. 

Christ never said baptizing them in the name of God, the Father, of God, the Son and of God, the Holy Ghost. That will be making it three gods Deut. 6:4, “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:”. Neither did Christ say baptizing them inthe NAMES, as in plural, but name knowing that Father is not a name, Son is not a name nor is Holy Ghost a name; for were each of these a name, then wouid it have been out of place to say “in the Name’. it would have been pluralized. The three attributes were description of one person whom Christ could not just expressly mention. 

Let us make an illustration: | have a father, a wife, through whom I have a son and a dark complexioned man. I'm a father to my son, a son to my father, a husband to my wife and a dark complexioned man. | alone, I'm a father, son, husband and dark in complexion. That doesn't make four distinct persons or four persons in one; neither are father, son, husband and dark in complexion my names, they are only attributes that describe me. There are many fathers, countless sons and numerous husbands and copious dark complexioned men in the world, 

a 2 — 
but when referring to me, being one of these many fathers who also is a son, a husband and dark complexioned man, then my name has to be mentioned to be specific. 

When Jesus Christ said, “...baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:” He didn’t mention the name because, He had earlier said in St. Jonn16:12-13, that “Il have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth...”. So what is the name since Father is not a name, Son is not a name and Holy Ghost is not a name? As Christ, Himself had said, when the Spirit of truth (the Holy Ghost) came down on the day of Pentecost, He really guided them into the truth, for the first doctrine taught on that day of Pentecost was baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ: Acts 2:37-38 “Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and BE BAPTIZED every one of you in the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.” 

Some Christians do claim that Peter's doctrine on baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:38) was contrary to the command Christ gave them in Matthew 28:19 and as such, Peter was wrong. Looking atActs 2:41 and 47, “Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls...Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.” God vindicated this doctrine. How could God vindicate something that is contrary to His Word, a direct disobedience to His command? Thatis a shallow inference. 

let us also reflect onActs 19:1-6 1. And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at 

a 3 






Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples, 2. Hesaid unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said untohim, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. 

3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. 4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the 

baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus. 

5 When they heard this, they were e baptized i in the name of the Lord Jesus. 6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy 

Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. 

God confirmed the water baptism in Jesus Christ's Name by baptizing those disciples with the Holy Ghost. 

Search the whole Bible, there is not a single place where after : the death, burial and resurrection of Christ, anybody was ever baptized outside of the Name of Jesus Christ. Consider the following passages of Scriptures: 

Acts 8:14-17 

14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria hadreceivedthe word o | f God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 

15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: 

16 (Foras yethe was fallen uponnoneofthem: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) 

17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. 

Acts 10:47-48 AT Can any man forbid water, that these should not be 

—GaaK 4 



baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we? 

48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayedtheyhimtotarry certain days. 

All the water baptisms were in Jesus Christ's Name. Even Apostle Paul had to be baptized in Jesus Christ's Name before he started his ministry. (Acts 22:14-16). 

For Salvation and Redemption of man from his fallen state, God had to take on flesh to become human (John 1:1 and 14) and took a human name (Jesus). There is no other name for Salvation, but Jesus. “Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. NEITHER IS THERE SALVATION IN ANY OTHER: FOR THERE IS NONE OTHER NAME UNDER HEAVEN GIVEN AMONG MEN, WHEREBY WE MUST BE SAVED.” Acts 4:10-12. Elohim, El-Shaddai, Jehovah, Rose-oi-Sharon, Emmanuel etc were not given for Salvation. “And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus...” Colossians 3:17. 

The Importance of Water Baptism 

Some Christians claim that water baptism is not compulsory for Salvation. | invite them to reflect on the following statements of Scriptures: 

| Peter 3:21 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer ofa 

good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ: 

GEE 5 

Rh = = ] } I) 

ry, 


Romans 6:4 

Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness Of life. 

Colossians 2:12 Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him 

through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead. 

Mark 1 6:1 5-16 

15 And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. 

-16 He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he 

-that believeth not shall be damned. 

ACTS 2:38 | ' 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized ' every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ FOR THE REMISSION OF SINS, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 

From the last verse of Scriptures quoted above (Acts 2:38) it is clear that without repentance and baptism in the Name of Jesus Christ, there is no remission of sins. Anybody who has not been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ is still retaining his or her sins. 

According To History 

{) BRITANICA ENCYCLOPEDIA 11" Edition, Vol3 p 365 -366 “The Baptism formula was changed from the name of Jesus Christ to the words Father, Son and 

Holy Ghost by the Catholic church in the fourth Century.” 


m BRITANICA ENCYCLOPEDIA vol. 3 page 82 “Everywhere in the oldest source, it states that baptism took place in the name of Jesus Christ. 

4) CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA Vol. 2 Page 241 Here 

the Catholics accepted that Baptism was 

changed by the Catholic Church. sug 4) DICT. OF THE BIBLE BY SCRIBBNER Vol. 2 page . 377-378, 389 “The original form of words were into 

the name of Jesus Christ or Jesus. Baptisminto t h e Trinity was a later development.” 

@ HASTINGS ENCYCLOPEDIA OF REL. Vol. 2 page 377-378, 389 “Christian baptism was administered the words 'in the name of Jesus.’ The use of trinity formula of any sort was not suggested in - the early Church history. Baptism was always in the 

name of the Lord Jesus until the time of Justin Martyr when triune formula was used.” 

(4) NEW INTERNATIONAL ENCYCLOPEDIA Vol. 1 page447 “The term Trinity was originated by... Tertullian, a Roman Catholic church father.” 

Conclusion 

The Trinitarian teaching on water baptism only came to play in , AD325, an out come of the Nicene Council. Until then, water 

baptism was in Jesus Christ's Name. This wrong doctrine has 

seen its way through all the ages from then until God sent His 

prophet, William Marrion Branham to the last (seventh) Church 

Age, the Laodicea Church Age (Revelation 3:14-22), who 

came with the spirit of Elijah (Malachi 4:5-6) to correct all the 

errors in Christendom (Revelation 10:7, Luke 17:30). Some of 

those errors are being discussed in this publication. 

aaa / 

Finally dear reader, having carefully studied the above subject 

of Water Baptism and found out that you have been wrongly 

baptized, | employ you to take the bold step of faith and be re

baptized correctly in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ just as 

Paul admonished the disciples at Ephesus to inActs 19. Forifa , - foundation is wrong, then the whole building cannot be right. 


GODHEADE 
Deut. 6:4, “Hear O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD 

The understanding on water baptism is directly associated with the truth about the Godhead. Churches today, traditionally believe in three separate or distinct persons in one God. This was arrived at due to Scriptural mentioning and deifying of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The result of the fourth century meeting of the Nicene Council was to place them under the Trinitarian definition. 

The Church lost the revelation that the one God, Jehovah, expressed Himself in the Old Testament as the Father, manifested Himself in the Gospels in the Son, Jesus and revealed Himself in the book of Acts as the Holy Ghost (Spirit). in reality, it is three dispensations of the same God: God above us; God with us; God in us. Not three persons, but one, manifesting Himself in three different offices. 

Let's take a look at the following Scriptures: 

LUKE 10:21-22 

21. ~ Inthat hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, ! thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. 22 ~All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. 

JOHN 5:19-23 

19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, ! say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. 

20 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than 

GEE 9 



these, that ye may marvel. 

21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. 

22. For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: 

23 That all men should honour the Son, even as . they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. 

JOHN 5:46 © 46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. 

JOHN 8:28-29 

.28 Thensaid Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that | am he, and that | do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, | speak these things. 

29 Andhethatsent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for |do always those things that please him. 

JOHN 20:17 

17 ~~ Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for | am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, | ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God. 

r ~ Considering the above Scriptures and many others, the ‘heathen, intellectual minds of the theologians could nof econcile the appearance of the Son on earth to the Father remaining in heaven and thereby decided there had to be at least two in the Godhead; and the entrance of the Holy Spirit in 

0 y 

- 




Acts 2 made it three they forgetting that God can be in heaven 

and on earth at the same time. John 3:13, “And no man hath | ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man WHICH IS IN HEAVEN.” Jesus speaking to Nicodemus on earth and telling him He was in heaven at the same time. 

They made the Son the second person in the Godhead, failing to realize that the Scriptures do not convey that Jesus is in the Godhead rather that the Godhead is in Jesus. Col. 2:9, “for in Him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.” They could only see that the Father is a God and the Son is a God and missed the true concept that the Father is God and Jesus (the manifestation of the Son) was the flesh or man in whom that God (Father) dwelt. Luke 1:35, “And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the SON Of GOD.” 

JOHN 1:1-3, 10 and 14 

1 Inthe beginning was the Word, andthe Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 Thesame was inthe beginning with God. 3 Aijl things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 

10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the worid knew him not. 

14 And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and 

we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, ) full of grace and truth. 

In St. John 1:1 above, the Greek word translated as the “Word” is “Logos”, which means Christ or the Anointing; the Greek word for “God” is “Theos” which denotes “a god” or “deity”. Since Greek was the universal language in the time of the 

= a 11 

Gospels (in the New Testament) hence, “Theos” was appropriated by the Jews and retained by Christians to denote 

the one true God, which in the Hebrew language is called “Elohim” 

Thus replacing the “Word” with “Logos” and “God” with “Elohim” in John 1:1 it will read “In the beginning was the 

LOGOS and the LOGOS was with ELOHIM and the LOGOS was ELOHIM” 

In verses 2 and 3 of the same John 1, replacing those words, it will read “The same (LOGOS) was in the beginning with ELOHIM. All things were made by him (LOGOS); and without .him (LOGOS) was not any thing made that was made.” This clearly shows that the creation in Genesis 1 “In the beginning ELOHIM created the heaven and the earth...” was done by 

Christ, the Logos making it very plain that Elohim, the Father and Christ the Son is the same person, not two. 

Verse 14, “And the LOGOS was made flesh GESUS), and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father {ELOHIM},) full of grace and truth.” This Logos which was Elohim became Jesus and dwelt with men. Meaning that Elohim became the Logos and the Logos was later covered with human flesh, Jesus in order to do the work of redemption. Il CORINTHIANS 5:19, “To wit, that GOD WAS IN CHRIST, reconciling the world unto himself, not 

imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.” 

ACTS 20:28 reads thus: 

Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to 

feed the church of GOD, which he hath purchased with HIS OWN BLOOD. 

The question is, where and when did God shed His blood? 122 


Hebrews 1:1-3a 

1. God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets, 

2 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of allthings, by whom 

also he made the worlds; 

3 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the EXPRESS IMAGE OF HIS PERSON... 

Hebrews 1:8 . 

But unto the SON he saith, THY THRONE, O GOD, IS FOR EVERAND EVER: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom 

John 14:7-10 . 

7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. 8 Philip. saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 

9 Jesus saith unto him, Have | been so > long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me .hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? 

10 Believest thou notthat!lamin the Father, and the Father in me? the words that | speak unto you | speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. 

Here is what Isaiah prophesied: ISAIAH 9:6, “ For unto us a child is born, unto us a SON is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, THE MIGHTY GOD, THE EVERLASTING FATHER, The Prince of Peace.”, referring to Jesus Christ as the mighty God and the everlasting Father. He is the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost, the all of it. 

GE 13 

JOHN 4:24, “God (ELOHIM, The FATHER) is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. In the words of Jesus Christ himself, talking about the Father; if God (the Father) is a Spirit and He is Holy and if there is only one Holy Spirit, itthen means that the Father is the Holy Spirit. 

JOHN 8:56, “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. ” 

Abraham saw Him in the return from the slaughter of kings as Melchizedek (Gen. 14:18-20). Now who is this Melchizedek? Let's see His description in the book of Hebrews: HEBREWS 7:1-3 

1 Forthis Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high 

God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him; 

2 Towhom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace; © 

3 Without father, without mother, without descent, having 

neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abidetha priest continually. 

These descriptions: Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; was 

not created. The only person that possesses these attributes is God Himself. 

Abraham saw Him also in Flesh when He came down to judge Sodom and Gomorrah; and to fulfill His promise to Abraham and called Abraham and his wife by their new names (Gen. 18); for He had changed their names from Abram and Sarai to 

‘Abraham and Sarah respectively two days before His physical appearance in human flesh(Gen. 17). In Genesis 18, the Bible declares that Abraham saw three men and entertained them 

with milk, butter, cake and meat. One of which was Elohim. He couldn't have eaten ina spiritual body. 

| 4 


Elohim in Genesis 18 said‘ to Abraham using the personal 

~ pronoun, “I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.” And Sarah laughed up her sleeve in the tent door behind Him, and He said, “Wherefore did Sarahlaugh?” | 

_ God appeared before Abraham many times, but two of these appearances were spectacular as Melchizedek and in flesh in the plains of Mamre. Abraham saw God do those works and that great sign of discernment before him and he was happy. 

Jesus was saying in John 8:56 that it was Him (Jesus) that ~ Abraham experienced. 

: In verse 58 of the same John 8, Jesus said, “before Abraham was, |AM” like He spoke to Moses in the 'burning bush’ “And God said unto Moses, | AM THAT IAM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, | AM hath sent me unto 

you. "Exodus 3:14. . 

‘Inthe Old Testament when God was in the office of the Father, 

He manifested Himself as a Pillar of Fire to Moses and the 

children of Israel (Exodus 3:2, 13:21). God led the children of 

Israel through the wilderness in The Pillar of Fire by night and 

‘Pillar of Cloud by day during the first Exodus under the ministry of Moses. 

‘Apostle Paul had a personal experience with The Pillar of Fire (Great Light), he didn't believe in Jesus, but in Jehovah. When he saw the Pillar of Fire on his road to Damascus and: The Voice said to him “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?” he knew as a true Jew that the visible form of Jehovah to man is The Pillar of Fire, The Great Light, he wondered how could he have persecuted Jehovah and so he asked “Who art thou, Lord?” The Voice replied “lam JESUS whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.” (Acts 9:3-5). Paul had to go to Arabia and for three years studied through the 

GE 15 — 

| 

Laws and the prophets (Galatians 1:16 18) to know the relationship between The Pillar of Fire and Josue Christ arid the relationship between Jehovah and Jesus Christ and found out that The Jehovah of the Old Testament is The Jesus Christ of the New Testament his revelation superseded that of the eleven apostles who walked with Jesus Christ physically because, he saw God in His original form. When Paul returned he said “without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, Justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory’. (! Timothy 3:16) 

God came down In the office of the Son. After fulfilling His purpose on earth, He returned to the Fatherhood (“...1 go to my Father, and ye see me no more;” John 16:10). On the road to Damascus, when He appeared to Saul who became Paul, He was back to “PILLAR of FIRE” again. “Our God is a consuming Fire” Deut. 4:24, 9:3, Heb. 12:29. 

Certain parts of the Scriptures, even from the words of Jesus Christ Himself suggest through common reasoning (humanly speaking) when reading, that the Father is a separate person from the Son and the Son a separate person from the Holy Ghost. it is a mystery that is why in | Timothy 3:16, Paul says, “And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the word, received up into glory.” That is without argument, the mystery of God is very great; ELOHIM was manifested In the flesh (JESUS) “...the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.” (John 14:10). Paul, at a time asked for prayers to be able to speak plainly on this mystery: Col. 4:3-4, “Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of CHRIST, for which | am also inbonds: That! may make it manifest, as | ought to speak.” 

Now this is my understanding of the Godhead: way back 

a 16 

before the beginning, before Genesis 1, nothing existed; there was no atom, no molecule, no air, nothing. The Bible clearly declares that there was no light, no darkness. There was just only a vast space of eternity and a Being filled that space just like the air fills the atmosphere. This Being the Hebrews call El, Elah, Elohim, The self existing One, the One that exists all by Himself 

The first thing He, (Elohim) did was to create a body, a SpiritWord-Body, which is referred to in Greek as “The Theophany” (God's Light). That is, God's Light made a Body. Then this Being that was Omnipresent by occupying all space, that is from Eternity to Eternity, emptied Himself into the Theophany Body. Col. 1:19 “For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;”. This became the first visible form of Elohim (not to the terrestrial being) {Col. 1:15 “who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature.”} called in Greek, The “Logos”, which is Christ (“The Anointing”), “The Supernatural Spirit Son of God”, “The Pillar of Fire”, “The Word of God”. This was the first creation of Elohim. Rev. 3:14d “...the beginning of the creation of God;” All that was in God, He Poured into Christ. 

Abraham saw God in the Theophany body as Melchisedec when returning from the slaughter of kings (Gen. 14:18-20, Heb. 7:1-3) and as reflected above, Jesus Christ said it was Him Abraham saw. Moses first saw him as the Pillar of Fire at the back side of the desert on Mt. Horeb (Gen. 3:2-6) and then in the clift of the rock (Exodus 33:22-23). 

In the beginning of all things, Elohim (in the Logos form) started the work of creation. He created angels first to worship Him, and then He became God (an object of worship). He created every other thing and then man. After creating man, He became YHWH which for ease of pronunciation we call Jehovah the one that exists with His family.

When the human race fell in the Garden of Eden and it was imperative to redeem it from its fallen state; after 4000 years of killing animals for the sin of mankind (the innocent for the guilty) and because, the animal life could not return to man being lower than human life, the sin problem remained until Christ came to pay the price. (Heb. 10:4, 10-12) 

God's law declares clearly that the penalty for sin is death. The only way for a man that sins to live, the blood (the seat of life) of another sinless man has to be shed, a guiltless man has to die in his place. It has to be a kinsman to redeem man, but because, we all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, no man was found worthy and it will not be just for God to send an angel to pay the price for man, He came down Himself and took the form of a man (John 1:14), a kinsman Redeemer to be the sacrificial Lamb John 1:29 “The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, _which taketh away the sin of the world.” God in the form of man as a kinsman Redeemer, took a human name, most befitting, “Jesus” meaning “Jehovah-Saviour”’ to pay the price for 

mankind and put to an end the sin problem and animal sacrifices (Heb. 10:10-14). 

Jesus Christ came as The Lamb of God to be the perfect Sacrifice that is why He was born in a manger. Lambs are not born in hospitals or maternity homes. Also, the news of His birth came first to shepherds and not to the high priest or 

anyone in the Temple because, shepherds take care of sheep. (Luke 2:7-12) 

Jesus Christ shed His blood for mankind so that His life can return back to man as the Holy Ghost Gal. 2:20 “l am crucified with Christ: nevertheless | live; yet not 1, but CHRIST LIVETH IN ME: and the life which | now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.” All 
18


that was in God, He poured into Christ and all that was in Christ, He poured into the Church. This is God's eternal purpose. God above us Father, God with us Son, God in us Holy Ghost; the same person in three offices or dispensations of His manifestations or operations. 

The teaching of “trinity’(which does not only lack bases on the Scripture, is totally an unscriptural word), has been passed down through the ages from AD 325 until God sent us a prophet who came with the spirit of Elijah according to Mal. 4:56, “Behold, | will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest | come and smite the earth with a curse.”, to correct this and other errors that have been injected into the Christian faith, turning our hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers(the apostolic doctrines) in this last age and bringing us to the full WORD of God. God, through this Elijah-prophet revealed all the hidden mysteries in the Bible according to Rev. 10:7, “But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.” 

Let us consider the following excepts on this subject of the Godhead. 

-Now all these expressions, 'Him Which Is', and 'Him Which Was’, and 'Is To Come’, and ‘Faithful Witness’, and 'First-born From Among the Dead’, and ‘Prince of the Kings of the Earth’, and ‘The Alpha and Omega’, and ‘The Almighty’, are titles and descriptions of the ONE AND THE SAME PERSON, Who is the Lord Jesus Christ, Who washed us from our sins in His own blood. 

The Spirit of God in John expresses thusly in order to set forth the Supreme Deity of Jesus Christ and to reveal the Godhead as ONE God. Today there is a gross error. It is that there are 

a 19 



three Gods instead of one. This revelation as given to John by Jesus, Himself, corrects that error. It is not that there are three Gods, but one God with three offices. There is ONE God with three titles, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. This mighty revelation is what the early church had, and it must be restored in this iast day along with the correct formula of water baptism. 

Now modern theologians won't agree with me for here is what 

_ was written in a great Christian magazine. . 

. ° "That teaching (on the Trinity) is at the very heart and core of the Old Testament. It is every whit as much at the 

~: heart and core of the New Testament. 

The New Testament is just as much 

_ opposed as the Old Testament is to the

one. Yet the New Testament with equal clearness teaches that the Father is . 

God, and the Son is God, and the Holy 

Spirit is God, and that these three are 

- NOT three aspects of the same Person, 

but three persons standing in a truly 

. personal relationship to one another. 

There we have the great doctrine of the . 

-Three Persons but one God." 7 

They also state, "God, according to the Bible, is -not just one person, but He is three persons in one God. That is the great mystery of the Trinity". 

- It sure is: How can three persons be in one God? Not only is there no Bible for it, but it shows even a lack of intelligent reasoning. Three distinct persons, though identical substance, make three gods, or language has lost its meaning entirely. 

20 

Just listen to these words again, "| am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, saith the Lord, Which Is, and Which Was, and Which Is to Come, the Almighty”. This is Deity. This is not simply a prophet, a man. This is God. And it is not a revelation of three Gods, but of ONE God, the Almighty. 

They didn't believe in three Gods in the beginning of the church. You can't find that sort of belief amongst the apostles. It was after the apostolic age that this theory came in and really became an issue and a cardinal doctrine at the Nicene Council. The doctrine of Godhead caused a two way split at Nicaea. And from that split there came two extremes. One actually went into polytheism, believing in three Gods, and the others went into unitarianism. Of course that was a little while in coming about, but it did, and we have it right today. But the Revelation through John by the Spirit to the churches was, "I am the Lord Jesus Christ, and | am ALL of it. There isn't any other God". And He put His seal on this Revelation. 

Consider this: Who was the Father of Jesus? Matthew 1:18 says, "She was found with child of the Holy Ghost". But Jesus, Himself, claimed that God was His Father. God the Father and God the Holy Ghost, as we often express these terms, make the Father and the Spirit ONE. Indeed they are, or else Jesus had two Fathers. But notice that Jesus said that He and His Father were One--not two. That makes ONE God. 

Since this is historically and Scripturally true, people wonder where the three came from. It became a foundational doctrine at the Nicene Council in 325 A.D. This trinity (an absolutely unscriptural word) was based upon the many gods of Rome. The Romans had many gods to whom they prayed. They also prayed to ancestors as mediators. It was just a step to give new names to old gods, so we have saints to make it more Biblical. Thus, instead of Jupiter, Venice, Mars, etc., we have Paul, 

—21? | 

Peter, Fatima, Christopher, etc., etc. They could not make their pagan religion work out with just one God, so they split Him up into three, and they made intercessors of the saints as they had made intercessors of their ancestors. 

Ever since then people have failed to realize that there is just 

one God with three offices or manifestations. They know there is one God according to Scripture, but they try to make it the fantastic theory that God is like a bunch of grapes; three persons with the same Divinity shared equally by all. But it plainly says here in Revelation that Jesus is "That Which Is’, "That Which Was", and "That Which Is to Come”. He is the "Alpha and Omega", which means that He is the "A to Z" or THE ALL OF IT. He is everything the Almighty. He is the Rose of Sharon, the Lily of the Valley, the Bright and Morning Star, the Righteous Branch, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. He is God, Almighty God. ONE GOD. 

| Timothy 3:16 says, "And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into Glory". This is what the Bible says. It doesn't say a thing about a first or second or third person here. It says God was manifest in flesh. One God. That ONE GOD was manifested in flesh. That ought to settle it. God came ina human form. That didn't make Him ANOTHER GOD. HE WAS GOD, THE SAME GOD. It was a revelation then, and itis arevelation now. One God. 

Let's go back in the Bible and see what He was in the beginning according to the revelation He gave of Himself. The great Jehovah appeared to Israel in a PILLAR of FIRE. As the Angel of the Covenant He lived in that pillar of fire and led Israel daily. At the temple He announced His coming with a great cloud. Then one day He was manifested in a virgin born body that was prepared for Him. The God that tabernacled above 

22? 



the tents of Israel now took on Himself a tent of flesh and tabernacled as a man amongst men. But He was the SAME GOD. 

The Bible teaches that GOD WAS IN CHRIST. The BODY was Jesus. In Him dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead, BODILY. Nothing can be plainer than that. Mystery, yes. But actual truth it can't be plainer. So if He wasn't three people then, He can't be three now. ONE GOD: And this same God was made flesh. 

Jesus said, "| came from God and | go (back) to God”. John 16:27-28. That is exactly what happened. He disappeared from earth by way of His death, burial, resurrection, and ascension. Then Paul met Him on the road to Damascus and He spoke to Paul and said, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me?" Paul said, "Who art Thou, Lord?" He said, "I am Jesus.” He was a PILLAR of FIRE, a blinding light. He had turned back, exactly as He said He would. Back to the same form that He was before He took on a tabernacle of flesh. That is exactly how John saw it. John 1:18 "No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, Which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him". Notice where John says that Jesus IS. He is IN the bosom of the Father. 

Luke 2:11 says, 

“For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, Which is Christ the Lora”. 

He was born the Christ, and eight days later when He was circumcised He was named Jesus, even as the angel had told them. | was born a Branham. When | was born they gave me the name of William. He was CHRIST but He was given a name down here among men. That outward tabernacle men could see was called Jesus. He was the Lord of Glory, the Almighty manifested in flesh. He is God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. He is all that. 

G23 



Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are just titles. They are not names. That is why we baptize in the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, for that is aname, nota title. Itis the name of those titles, just like you take a new born baby who is a son and name him. Baby is what it is, son is the title, then you name him, John Henry Brown. You just don't baptize in 'Jesus Name’. There are thousands of Jesuses in the world and have been even before Jesus, our Saviour. But there is only one of them born the Christ, "Lord Jesus Christ". 

People talk about Jesus being the Eternal Son of God. Now isn't that a contradiction? Whoever heard of a ‘Son’ being eternal? Sons have beginnings, but that which is eternal never had a beginning. He is the Eternal God (Jehovah) manifested in the flesh. 

God has many titles: 'Our Righteousness’, and ‘Our Peace’, and ‘Ever Present’, and 'Father', and 'Son', and 'Holy Ghost’; but He has only one human name and that name is Jesus. 

Don't be confused because he has three offices or that He has a threefold manifestation. On earth He was a Prophet; in heaven He is the Priest; and coming back to earth, He is King of Kings. "He That Was" That is Jesus, the Prophet. "He That Is" That is He, the High Priest, making intercession One Who can be touched with the feelings of our infirmities. "Which Is to Come" That is the coming King. On earth He was the Word the Prophet. Moses said of Him, "The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet like unto me, and it will come to pass if they don't hear the words of that Prophet they will be cut off from amongst the people". 

Notice these facts about Jesus. On earth He was Prophet, Lamb, and Son. This did not make Him three. These were but manifestations or offices of the One Person, Jesus. 

Now there is a very favorite portion of Scripture that the GE 2 4 — 






trinitarians think prove their point of more than one actual Person in the Godhead. 

Itis Revelation 5:6-8, 

"And | beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as It had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And He came and took the book out of the right hand of Him That sat upon the throne. And when He had taken the book, the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odors, which are the prayers of saints". 

Indeed these verses, if isolated, would seem to prove their point. You notice, | said, these ISOLATED verses. However, read Revelation 4:2-3 and 9-11, 

“And immediately | was in the Spirit: and behold, a throne was setin heaven, and ONE sat on the throne. And He That sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine Stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald. And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to Him That sat on the throne, Who liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before Him That sat on the throne, and worship Him That liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and Power: for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created." 

Carefully note in verse two it says, "ONE" (not two or three but ONE) sat on the throne. In Verse three it says, "HE" (NOT they) was to look upon as a jasper stone. In verse nine it says that the beasts gave honour to "HIM" (not them). In verse ten it says that the elders fell down before "HIM" (not them). In verse eleven it says that they cried, Thou art worthy O LORD" (not Lords). Also in verse eleven it says this ONE on the throne was 

— mma 25 

the "Creator", Which is Jesus (John 1:3), Which is JehovahSpirit-God of the Old Testament (Genesis 1:1). 

But let us not stop there. Read now in Revelation 3:21, 

"To him that overcometh will | grant to sit with Me in My throne, even as | also overcame, and am set down with My Father in His throne.” Also read Hebrews 12:2, 

"Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our faith; Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God." 

Notice that according to Jesus, Himself, Who wrote the Revelation, He is set down WITH the Father. The Spirit in Paul (Which Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, for That is the Spirit of Prophecy whereby the Word comes) says He is set down at the RIGHT HAND of God. But when John looked he saw only "ONE" upon the throne. And it was not until Revelation 5:6-8 (which follows Revelation 4:2-3 in sequence of time) that we see the "Lamb" taking the book from "HIM" That sat on the throne, as indicated in Revelation 4:2-3 and 9-10. What is it? It is the mystery of "ONE GOD." He (Jesus), came out from God, became manifested in flesh, died and rose again, and returned to the "Bosom of the Father." As John said, "The only begotten Son Which is IN the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him." John 1:18. It was now time for God (Messiah) to come back to claim His bride and then present Himself (make Himself known) to Israel. Thus we see God again stepping forth to assume a physical relationship to man as the “Son of David, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, and Bridegroom of the Gentile Bride." It is NOT "Two" Gods, but simply ONE GOD 

manifesting His mighty triune offices and titles... - An Exposition of The Seven Church Ages” Chapter 1(The Revelation of Jesus Christ), page 17 to 23.
